    <h1>1.QingPing Market</h1>

    </p>
    <h2>2.Shawan Ancient Town</h2>
    <p>A village that had remained unchanged. A beautiful place to see traditional Cantonese houses and 
   </p>
   <h2>3.Yuyin Garden</h2>
   <p>Many miss its quieter corners. Look for hidden rockeries, bamboo groves, and shaded ponds where koi swim undisturbed. The design is intended for subtlety rather than grandeur—perfect for a contemplative walk.</p>
   <h2>4.Liwan Lake Park<h2>
    <p>Beyond a simple park, it's a hub for social life: locals dancing in groups, practicing martial arts, and playing traditional instruments. Visiting early in the morning is like stepping into a living painting.</p>
    <h2>5.Baiyun Mountain(White Cloud Mountain)</h2>
    <p>Explore paths that lead to hidden pavilions, ancient temples and quiet streams. A mixture of nature of nature and urban life.</p>
    <h2>6.Chen Clan Ancestrall Hall</h2>
    <p>Often overshadowed by more famous temples, this hall is a masterclass in Lingnan architecture: delicate wood carvings, intricate ceramics, and hidden courtyards. It’s not just a museum—it's an active community space with workshops.</p>
    <h2>7.Huacheng Square & Zhujiang New Town</h2>
    <p>Guangzhou's “financial district” has more than glass towers. Check out the reflective fountains at night, public art installations, and the view of Canton Tower from unusual angles that most tourists miss.</p>
    <h2>8.Liwan Bazaar / Shangxiajiu Pedestrian Street</h2>
    <p>Not just shopping—wander the side alleys for street snacks that don't make it into the guidebooks. Think handmade dumplings, unique pastries, and snacks sold by vendors who have been there for decades.</p>
    <h2>9. Canton Tower Observation Deck</h2>
    <p>Experience the glass-bottomed skywalk and the LED light patterns at night. It's an immersive way to experience the city skyline differently.</p>
    <h2>10.Hualin Temple</h2>
    <p>Hualin is over 1,500 years old and features intricate stone carvings, courtyards, and a pond where koi fish reside.</p>
